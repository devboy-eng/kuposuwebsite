# How to Add Your LinkedIn Article Images

Since I cannot directly access the image URLs from your LinkedIn posts due to platform restrictions, here's how you can easily add them:

## Method 1: Extract Images from LinkedIn Posts

1. **Go to your LinkedIn company page**: https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuposu-ai/
2. **For each article, right-click on the image** and select "Copy image address" or "Copy image URL"
3. **Replace the current Unsplash URLs** in `index.html` with your LinkedIn image URLs

## Method 2: Download and Upload Images

1. **Download images from each LinkedIn post**
2. **Upload them to your project folder** (create an `images` folder)
3. **Update the HTML** to use local image paths

## Current Image URLs to Replace:

### Article 1: Karnataka's Idea2PoC Grant-in-Aid Scheme
**Current**: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507003211169-0a1dd7228f2d?...`
**Replace with**: Your LinkedIn post image URL

### Article 2: Software Development & Subscription-Based Growth  
**Current**: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553028826-f4804a6dba3b?...`
**Replace with**: Your LinkedIn post image URL

### Article 3: Meta, Facebook, Instagram & LinkedIn API Integrations

### Article 6: Turn Your Ideas Into Powerful Software
**Current**: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?...`
**Replace with**: Your LinkedIn post image URL

## Alternative: No Images Option

If you prefer to remove images from blog cards entirely, I can update the CSS to create a clean text-only design that still looks professional.

Would you like me to:
1. Help you implement Method 2 (download/upload approach)?
2. Create a no-images version?
3. Wait for you to provide the LinkedIn image URLs?
